# PredictionsUsingGridSearch
## Overview
There are three parts to this project, each having their own objectives and using their own datasets

## 1. Gini Impurity Calculator
This section provides a utility function to calculate **Gini Impurity**, a metric commonly used in decision tree algorithms to evaluate the purity of a dataset split.

### Functionality
- Accepts a list of any size representing the count of samples in each class.
- Computes the Gini Impurity using the formula:

  \[
  G = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{c_i}{N} \right)^2
  \]

  where \( c_i \) is the count of class \( i \), and \( N \) is the total number of samples.
- Prints the score to the console

## 2. Machine Maintenance Prediction
## 3. CSGO Round Prediction
